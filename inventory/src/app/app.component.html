      <h2>Welcome to Smart Inventory Website</h2>
      <p>Smart inventory system will help a businessman manage his online store.<br>
        Admin problem is that the physical stores usually have restrictions on the number of products one can buy at most during sale time.<br>
        So Admin recruits some people to buy these products and send them to Adminâ€™s Amazon store. <br>
        Now Admin wants an inventory system to keep the inventory and billing records.<br>
        Users can view the ads the admin posted and contact admin accordingly.</p>
